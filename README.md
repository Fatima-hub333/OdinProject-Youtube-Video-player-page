> The OdinProject-Youtube-Video-player-page

I have to Create a blank HTML document. Come up with a plan -- which sections of the page should be grouped together (e.g. the navigation bar vs the video vs the sidebar etc)?.
- Create empty semantic HTML elements to enclose those sections.
- Use basic CSS to size and position them appropriately on the page. It may be helpful to make their backgrounds different colors so you can see the different sections. Don't forget to use your browser's developer tools.
- Now let's start filling in those divs with content by creating the navbar.
- Build the sidebar section where previews of suggested videos show up. Obviously don't worry about generating those previews, just grab some thumbnail-sized images and plug them in.
- Next, finish up by filling in some of the elements below the video (the title, description and number of views).


## Built With
